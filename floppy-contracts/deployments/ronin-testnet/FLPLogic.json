Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\\\n *\\\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\\\\\"step\\\\\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\\\n *\\\\n * For example:\\\\n *\\\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\\\n * ```solidity\\\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\\\\\"MyToken\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"MTK\\\\\\\");\\\\n *     }\\\\n * }\\\\n *\\\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\\\\\"MyToken\\\\\\\");\\\\n *     }\\\\n * }\\\\n * ```\\\\n *\\\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\\\n *\\\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\\\n *\\\\n * [CAUTION]\\\\n * ====\\\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\\\n *\\\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.
